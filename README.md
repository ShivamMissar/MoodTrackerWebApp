Welcome to the Mood-Tracker Web Application. 

The application focuses on tracking the user's mental health through mood tracking.The goal of the application is to slowly increase the user's mental health through pattern identification of moods and what triggers their mood.

The application requires the user to be registered and logged in. To then track their mental health the application requires the user to submit a mood entry via clicking the log mood entry button found on the homepage. Once submitted, the user can view their logs on the timeline for the most recently logged mood entries. For past entries, users can then find their entries and view them on a different page. To search entries, the user can enter a format like '07/07/2024' and it will bring those entries.
